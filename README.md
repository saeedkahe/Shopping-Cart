# Shopping-Cart

### Hello 👋
This is a shopping cart that is mostly focused on JavaScript❤️.<br>
<hr>

### part 1 
Well, first we did the HTML structures and improved the design with CSS. I considered three products that you can consider more.<br>
<hr>

### part 2
In the next step, we will get to JavaScript, where we need to get different accesses and make our shopping cart dynamic.<br>

Well, the user can click once on each product and then a message will be sent that the product is available.<br>

If the user closes the browser page and opens it again, the values ​​that are in the basket will not change and will be saved in the browser's memory.<br>
Finally, the total price is displayed.<br>
The user can increase or decrease the number of products.<br>
### That was all!
